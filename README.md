# Tony Landek – Educator, Designer, & Tinkerer

Hello! My name is Tony.

I have worked in a variety of areas in education and technology—K-12 STEM/CS education, ed tech smart toys, out-of-school learning, digital literacy, educational kit design, and post-secondary access.

I am an educator that is passionate about building things that allow students to learn by creating. I’m interested in designing programs, products, and technology that empower learners in underserved and low-income communities to realize their untapped creative potential through maker and constructionist education.

I spent the last year and a half building and running a makerspace at MIND+HAND, a community non-profit on the Southwest side of Chicago. The main goal of the space, outside of creating an impactful, engaging learning environment, was to develop an open-access space that lowered as many barriers to using the space as possible. Unfortunately, the space closed to the public in May 2019 due to changing priorities at MIND+HAND.


Currently, I am doing work with the community development & advanced manufacturing departments at Ricard J. Daley College Manufacturing Technology and Engineering Center’s newly launched makerspace to create and facilitate courses on making & advanced manufacturing for local high school students. Additionally, I am always sharing my education & design knowledge with different organizations by facilitating maker/design workshops for young students to adult learners, conducting professional development sessions for educators, and assisting in product design & UX research with companies that design learning kits for STEM/maker education.
